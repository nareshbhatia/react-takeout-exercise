# Part 3: Implement Order View

In this part, we will implement the right side of the order page, which is the
order view.

## Instructions

- `OrderView` uses an `Order` object to render its contents. The type definition
  of `Order` has been supplied to you. Copy it from `/code/src/models/Order.ts`
  in this repo to `/src/models/Order.ts` in your repo.

- Review the `Order` type. Note that it consists of an id (not used in this
  exercise) and an array of order items. Order items contain the associated menu
  item's id, name and price.

- As shown in the visual design, when the order is empty (i.e. no order items),
  `OrderView` should show a message to click menu items to get the order
  started. When there are one or more order items in the order, `OrderView`
  should show a Checkout button and the order total.

- `MenuView` and `OrderView` need to coordinate with each other. When a menu
  item is clicked, a new `OrderItem` should be created and added to the order.
  We will do this using an `OrderContext`. This context will sit at the
  `OrderPage` level and carry the current order. Create `OrderContext` at
  `/src/pages/OrderPage/OrderContext.tsx`. Use the pattern that is used in the
  [Accelerated News](https://github.com/PublicisSapient/accelerated-news)
  example - see
  [AuthContext.tsx](https://github.com/PublicisSapient/accelerated-news/blob/main/src/contexts/AuthContext/AuthContext.tsx).
  `AuthContext` carries `AuthState` and `AuthStateSetter`. Similarly,
  `OrderContext` should carry an `Order` and an `OrderSetter`. We will also
  create an `OrderContextProvider` and a `useOrderContext` hook in the
  `OrderContext.tsx` file. If you are curious, this pattern has been popularized
  by Kent C. Dodds in his blog article
  [How to use React Context effectively](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively).

- Provide `OrderContext` to the entire `OrderPage` by adding it to
  `OrderPage.tsx`. We now have a mechanism to communicate order item creation
  from `MenuView` to `OrderView`.

- Modify `MenuItemView.tsx` to use the `useOrderContext` hook. Allow
  `MenuItemView` to add an `OrderItem` to the `OrderContext` whenever it is
  clicked. This completes the wiring of the `MenuView`.

- Now wire the `useOrderContext` hook into the `OrderView`. OrderView should
  rerender order items whenever `OrderContext` changes. It should also recompute
  the total at this time.

- The total should be formatted with thousands separators. Use
  `NumberUtils.formatAsMoney()` for this.

- Allow deletion of order items using the delete icon shown in the visual
  design. Use react-icons to render the delete icon:
  `import { AiTwotoneDelete } from 'react-icons/ai`.

- Finally, navigate to a `CheckoutPage` when the user clicks on the 'Checkout'
  button. Create a placeholder page for this at
  `/src/pages/CheckoutPage/CheckoutPage.tsx`. Wire it into the router. The
  checkout page should have a link back to the order page. See the visual design
  below:

- Run your test suite again to make sure that all your tests are running
  successfully (`npm test`). You will find that it fails because of the
  introduction of `OrderContext`. `MenuView` now needs to be wrapped with
  `OrderContextProvider`. Fix your test suite by making this change to
  `MenuView` and `MenuItemView` tests.

- Add one more test for `MenuItemView` to verify that it adds the item to the
  order when clicked. This test can be heavily simplified by creating a simpler
  `OrderView` local to the test - this one simply renders a list of order items
  from the order context. This approach is in line with the
  [React Testing Library Guiding Principles](https://testing-library.com/docs/guiding-principles/):
  _It is generally useful for testing the application components in the way the
  user would use it_.

- Add two tests to verify that the `OrderView` renders correctly when the order
  contains no items vs. one or more items.

- Add a test to make sure that the delete button on order items deletes the item
  from the order.

- Write a Storybook story to show your `OrderView` component. Set up the
  `OrderContext` to show a few orders.

- Write an integration test using Cypress to test the takeout workflow. Start by
  adding a few items to the order, then delete one or more items. Finally, click
  on the checkout button to navigate to the checkout page.

That's it for part 3. You are done! Go celebrate!
